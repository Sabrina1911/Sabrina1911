## Academic & Technical Portfolio

Hi.  
I am a Software Engineering Co-op student with industry experience in **Software Testing (Manual & Automation)** and **Business Analysis**, and I am currently expanding my skill set in **Applied Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**.

This GitHub profile contains **curated academic and technical projects** from my previous and current programs, showcasing my progression from testing and functional analysis into software development and AI-driven problem solving.

---

### QA & Automation Projects
Projects focused on software quality, system reliability, and backend validation.

- Automated testing using **Java, Selenium, TestNG**
- API validation using **Postman** and **Rest Assured**
- SQL-based backend data validation
- Manual, regression, and integration testing aligned with real enterprise workflows

---

### Software Engineering Coursework
Hands-on projects emphasizing programming fundamentals and system behavior.

- Object-Oriented Programming in **Java**
- Backend logic and data handling using **SQL & MongoDB**
- REST API testing and validation
- Version control and collaboration using **Git & GitHub**

---

### AI & Machine Learning (In Progress)
Current academic work focused on applying AI techniques to practical problems.

- Data preprocessing and analysis using **Python, Pandas, NumPy**
- Supervised learning models (classification & regression)
- Academic projects related to **energy optimization and efficiency analysis**
- Experiment tracking and documentation using **Jupyter Notebooks**
