## Academic & Technical Portfolio

I am a Software Engineering Co-op student with industry experience in Software Testing (Manual & Automation) and Business Analysis, currently expanding into Applied Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning with a strong focus on efficiency, system behavior, and responsible AI design.

This GitHub profile contains curated academic and technical projects that reflect my progression from testing and functional analysis into software development, AI experimentation, and system-level optimization.

**Featured Project — CarbonLensAI**

CarbonLensAI is an AI-driven prompt optimization and efficiency analysis system inspired by the Green AI philosophy.
The system is implemented using a modular Python pipeline with a Streamlit-based UI for interactive prompt optimization and evaluation.

*What it does:*

* Safely optimizes LLM instruction prompts using a learned T5 rewriter
* Preserves protected payloads (e.g., articles, transcripts) byte-for-byte
* Applies semantic safety gates (embedding cosine similarity)
* Compares rule-based baselines vs learned optimization
* Reports token reduction, efficiency gains, and trade-offs

*Why it matters:*

* Demonstrates governed AI design (not blind optimization)
* Connects model efficiency to energy and carbon-aware thinking
* Designed for auditability, reproducibility, and academic evaluation

This project reflects my interest in building responsible, efficiency-aware AI systems that balance performance, safety, and real-world constraints.

**AI & Machine Learning (In Progress)**

Academic work focused on applying AI techniques to practical, system-level problems.

* Data preprocessing and analysis using Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Supervised learning models (classification & regression)
* Experiment tracking and documentation using Jupyter Notebooks
* Projects related to energy optimization, efficiency analysis, and AI evaluation metrics
---
**Notes for Reviewers**

* Projects are intentionally curated to reflect learning depth, not just volume
* Earlier projects demonstrate strong QA and system fundamentals
* Recent work reflects a shift toward AI-driven optimization and responsible system design
* Additional AI and software engineering projects will be added as coursework progresses
